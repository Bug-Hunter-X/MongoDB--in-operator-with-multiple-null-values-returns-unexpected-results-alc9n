# MongoDB $in Operator with Multiple Null Values

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue encountered when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with multiple `null` values.  The issue occurs when you try to query documents where a field has one of several null values.  The expected behavior is to return all documents where the field is null. However, the query may sometimes unexpectedly return an empty result set.

## Problem
The `$in` operator is typically used to query documents where a field matches any of the values within an array. However, when the array consists entirely of `null` values, the query may not function as expected, potentially returning an empty result set rather than the documents with `null` fields. This inconsistency may lead to incorrect data retrieval and application errors. 

## Solution
The correct way to query for `null` values is to use the `$eq` operator or directly compare the field to `null`.
